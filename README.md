# Workshop Syllabus 

#### QCL Literacy: Level 2 - Data, Progamming

Instructor: Jeho Park, Director of the Quantitative and Computing Lab at Claremont McKenna College

## Summary

Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping, and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that data analysists and data scientists spend 80% of their time (or more) on data wrangling. So, it's essential to get familiar with good data wrangling skills and tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse, especially dplyr and ggplot2.

Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)

- Import and export data
- Clean, reshape, and transform data
- Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits)

## Prerequisites
