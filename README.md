# Workshop Syllabus 

QCL Literacy: Level 2 - Data, Progamming

## Summary

Data wrangling is the process of obtaining, cleaning, reshaping and transforming raw (and messy) data into a useable form of processed (and tidy) data. It is known that a majority of data analysists and data scientists spend as much as 80% of their time on data wrangling. So it's essential to get familiar with good data wrangling tools that help you save time and avoid errors. In this hands-on workshop, you will learn basic skills to import, export, clean, reshape, transform, and visualize data using well-known data science package called tidyverse.

Learning Objectives: (You will learn how to)

- Import and export data
- Clean, reshape and transform data
- Make messy data into tidy data
- Visualize tidy data using ggplot2 (if time permits)
